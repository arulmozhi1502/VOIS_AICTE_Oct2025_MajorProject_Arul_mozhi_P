Understanding Netflix’s Global Footprint: Evolution of Genres, Growth Patterns, and Regional Diversity

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Netflix has become one of the most prominent global streaming platforms, continuously expanding its library with a mix of original productions and licensed content. However, with growing competition from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT providers, Netflix must strategically analyze its content catalog to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities.  

The specific problem to be addressed in this project is 'Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations'. The aim is to uncover how Netflix’s content distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country contributions) has evolved over the years. This will enable the identification of key genres, audience preferences, and strategic insights into global content expansion. 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Analyze the distribution and growth of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix over the years.

Identify the most frequent genres and observe changes in their popularity.

Compare country-wise contributions to Netflix’s content base to assess global diversity.

Provide strategic recommendations for future content acquisition and production.

### Significance of the Study:
This analysis is significant for understanding Netflix’s content evolution and audience engagement patterns. By identifying popular genres and underrepresented regions, the study offers actionable insights that can help Netflix make data-driven business decisions. Such findings are valuable for:

Enhancing content strategy and balancing global vs. local productions.

Recognizing market trends and regional viewer interests.

Supporting strategic investments in specific content types and countries.
